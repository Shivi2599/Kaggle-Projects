# Kaggle Projects

Welcome to my **Kaggle Projects** repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing data analysis, visualization, and machine learning projects that I have completed using datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

Each project demonstrates different aspects of my analytical and problem-solving skills, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), pattern recognition, segmentation, and storytelling through visualizations.

## Projects Done

### *Sample Sales Analysis*

**Code:** [sales-data-analysis.ipynb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data/data) 

**Goal:** To analyze retail sales patterns and identify key factors influencing sales and customer behavior.

**Description:**
This project involves analyzing a sample dataset of retail sales that includes order information, customer demographics, shipping details, product categories, and revenue data. The goal is to uncover patterns, segment customers, and evaluate region- and product-level performance. The project covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving actionable business insights.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, data visualization, trend identification.
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:**

- Analysis revealed that certain product lines and customer types consistently drive higher sales and profit.
- Regional analysis showed clear variations in demand and shipping preferences.

### *Coffee Sales Analysis*

**Code:** [coffee-sales-analysis.ipynb](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivangi124/coffee-sales-analysis)

**Goal:** To explore and analyze coffee vending machine sales data to understand time-based patterns, customer preferences, and sales trends.

**Description:**
This project analyzes daily transaction records from a coffee vending machine, provided as an open dataset by Yaroslav Isaienkov. The dataset includes sales from March 2024 to the present. The project focuses on time series EDA, customer purchasing behavior, and forecasting future sales. Analysis was performed to uncover trends, peak sales periods, and preferences in coffee types.

**Skills:** Time series analysis, EDA, customer behavior analysis, trend detection

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, (optionally Prophet or statsmodels for forecasting).

**Results:**

- Identified peak purchase times and days with high sales volume.
- Detected consistent customer preferences for certain coffee products.
- Established a baseline for next-day and next-week sales forecasting.
- Insights support stocking decisions and marketing strategies for vending operations.
