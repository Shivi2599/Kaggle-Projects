# 🛍️ Sample Sales Data – Retail Analytics & Customer Segmentation

Welcome to my **Retail Sales Analytics Project**, part of my *Kaggle Projects* series. This project focuses on deriving actionable business insights from a sample sales dataset that includes order information, customer details, product categories, shipping data, and more. The dataset is ideal for segmentation, clustering, customer behavior analysis, and sales performance reporting.
